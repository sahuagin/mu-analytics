# ai-review.sh — pre-PR review PANEL gate (beads mu-6qst, mu-ai-review-panel-lrwq, mu-f0ls).
#
# A reviewer panel checks the working diff before a PR — a check on top of CI and
# the human/agent. Run it via `just ci-aipr`, which runs `just ci` first and only
# reviews green code.
#
# PANEL SHAPE (mu-f0ls): TWO primaries + a conditional TIEBREAKER.
#   Primary 1 (local):  qwen3-coder-next-agent262k over ollama — 3-GPU local
#                       agentic/code reviewer, 262k context, temp 0.6.
#   Primary 2:          deepseek-v4-pro over openrouter — frontier-ish and cheap.
#   Tiebreaker:         Claude over anthropic-api — invoked ONLY when the two
#                       primaries disagree, so the Anthropic key/cost is reserved
#                       for actual ties.
#
# WHY THIS SHAPE: the previous panel ran two LOCAL models co-resident (qwen +
# gpt-oss:20b) and dead-ended a split at the operator. gpt-oss@49152 truncated its
# review on larger diffs before the VERDICT line — a model that can't return a
# complete verdict adds no signal — and it over-flags (high recall, low precision),
# the wrong failure mode for a primary, where every noisy REJECT would drag a good
# PR to a tiebreak. So we drop the co-residency compromise: one PRECISE local
# primary that always answers, paired with gpt-5.5, and an INDEPENDENT third model
# (deepseek) to BREAK a genuine tie rather than bouncing every disagreement to the
# operator. gpt-oss keeps its Modelfile for the future review-gate v2 per-file
# worker role; it is just not a flat-panel primary. (co-residency bench: memory
# a721c14d; reviewers-as-team: d88e133e.)
#
# PANEL SEMANTICS (each verdict is read from reviewer STDOUT, NOT its process exit
# code — `mu ask` historically exits non-zero on a shutdown wart (mu-qc08) even on
# success, so the exit code is not load-bearing here):
#
#   both primaries APPROVE   → PASS     (exit 0)
#   both primaries REJECT    → BLOCK    (exit 1)  — a real design/correctness call
#   primaries disagree       → TIEBREAK: run deepseek; its verdict decides —
#         tiebreaker APPROVE → PASS     (exit 0)  — tiebroken
#         tiebreaker REJECT  → BLOCK    (exit 1)  — tiebroken
#         tiebreaker UNCLEAR → ESCALATE (exit 3)  — tie unbroken; operator decides
#   both primaries UNCLEAR   → ESCALATE (exit 3)  — no verdict to tiebreak (infra?)
#
# "disagree" INCLUDES the case where exactly one primary is UNCLEAR (no VERDICT
# line parsed): one real opinion + one missing is still a tie for deepseek to
# resolve. "both UNCLEAR" is held out — a tiebreaker breaks a tie between OPINIONS;
# with zero usable opinions there is nothing to break (likely a provider/infra
# fault), and a lone third model must not stand in for a dead panel. The non-pass
# paths have DISTINCT exit codes (BLOCK 1 vs ESCALATE 3) and verdict-naming
# messages. MU_REVIEW_OVERRIDE=1 is the operator's override on BLOCK *or* ESCALATE:
# it proceeds (exit 0) and is logged as a calibration signal.

#
# Env:
#   Primary 1 (default ollama / qwen-rev):
#     MU_REVIEW_PROVIDER        provider (default: ollama)
#     MU_REVIEW_MODEL           model    (default: qwen3-coder-next-agent262k)
#   Primary 2 (default openrouter / deepseek-v4-pro):
#     MU_REVIEW_PROVIDER_2      provider (default: openrouter)
#     MU_REVIEW_MODEL_2         model    (default: deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro)
#   Tiebreaker (default anthropic-api / claude-sonnet-4-6; runs ONLY on a split):
#     MU_REVIEW_PROVIDER_3      provider (default: anthropic-api)
#     MU_REVIEW_MODEL_3         model    (default: claude-sonnet-4-6)
#     MU_REVIEW_FALLBACK_PROVIDER  hosted provider primary-1 falls back to when
#                               the local ollama MODEL is NOT already resident
#                               (per /api/ps), so the gate never forces a model
#                               load/eviction. (default: openai-codex)
#     MU_REVIEW_FALLBACK_MODEL  hosted fallback model (default: gpt-5.5)
#   Shared:
#     MU_REVIEW_TOOLS           reviewer tools, e.g. "read,grep" (default: none, single-shot)
#     MU_REVIEW_BASE            base ref to diff against (default: main)
#     MU_REVIEW_FULL_FILES      1 = append full content of each changed file to the
#                               prompt so reviewers see definitions outside the diff
#                               window (default: 1; set 0 for diff-only)
#     MU_REVIEW_CONTEXT_MAX_BYTES  cap on appended full-file context (default: 200000)
#     MU_REVIEW_TIMEOUT         per-reviewer wall-clock cap, seconds (default: 600). Bounds a
#                               hung/slow model; reviewers run SEQUENTIALLY, so panel wall-clock
#                               is up to ~2x this (and up to ~3x when a split triggers the
#                               tiebreaker). 300 was too tight — a typical Claude/reasoning
#                               response (>5min) plus a possible ollama model reload (~2min)
#                               overran it, SIGTERMing the reviewer mid-stream before its final
#                               VERDICT line (spurious UNCLEAR).
#     MU_REVIEW_OVERRIDE=1      operator override: proceed despite BLOCK/ESCALATE (logged)
#     MU_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT   reviewer system-prompt file (default: ai-review-system-prompt.txt)
#     MU_REVIEW_LOG             event log (default: ~/.local/share/mu/review-events.jsonl)
#     MU_REVIEW_NO_COLOR        disable color
#   Chunked mode (review-gate v2 — beads mu-ja1x overflow detection, mu-u1it fan-out):
#     MU_REVIEW_SINGLE_SHOT_MAX_BYTES  cap on the assembled single-shot prompt, bytes
#                               (default 300000 ≈ 85k tokens at ~3.5 bytes/token —
#                               fits every panel model with headroom). At or under
#                               the cap the calibrated panel above runs untouched;
#                               over it the review is CHUNKED: one findings-only
#                               leaf per commit (primary 1's provider/model), then
#                               one synthesis verdict over all findings.
#     MU_REVIEW_HEAD            head rev of the review range (default: @ under jj,
#                               HEAD under git). Pins BASE..HEAD so a branch other
#                               than the checkout can be reviewed without moving
#                               the working copy. When set, full-file context is
#                               skipped (on-disk files belong to @, not HEAD).
#     MU_REVIEW_SYNTH_PROVIDER  synthesis provider (default: primary 2's)
#     MU_REVIEW_SYNTH_MODEL     synthesis model    (default: primary 2's)
#
# The log carries every reviewer's verdict: one {"event":"reviewer",...} line per
# reviewer that RAN plus one {"event":"panel",...} summary with the outcome and all
# three slots (r3_verdict is "" when the tiebreaker did not run). The panel line
# carries "mode":"single_shot"|"chunked" so dashboards can tell the paths apart.
# Chunked mode additionally writes one {"event":"leaf",...} line per leaf that
# returned usable findings and one {"event":"leaf_error",...} per leaf that did not.

# ── CHUNKED MODE (review-gate v2: beads mu-ja1x, mu-u1it) ───────────────────
#
# WHY: the single-shot panel dies on large branches — a ~1MB/12-commit branch
# overflowed every reviewer's context (one emitted 2 characters), and
# overflow-UNCLEAR is indistinguishable from substantive disagreement. So when
# the assembled single-shot prompt exceeds $SS_MAX the review splits BY COMMIT,
# never by file: a commit carries the author's stated intent, and review checks
# change-against-claim — a bare file slice has no claim attached. Each LEAF
# (primary 1: cheap, local) reports FINDINGS ONLY, no verdict; one SYNTHESIS
# pass (primary 2's lane: strong, cross-cutting) judges which findings are real
# and whether they interact across commits, and its verdict IS the gate verdict
# — the leaves are its eyes; no second panel vote in v1. A commit whose lone
# diff exceeds the cap is split per-file (same message, one file's diff per
# leaf). Failure honesty: a leaf that errors/times out/breaks the contract is
# logged as leaf_error and shown to synthesis as UNREVIEWED; if >1/3 of leaves
# fail, synthesis is SKIPPED and the gate ESCALATEs — it must not approve a
# mostly-unreviewed branch.

leaf_findings() { # stdin = raw leaf output -> <=5 FINDING| lines, or NO_FINDINGS, or "" (unusable)
  # Tolerate leading whitespace/markdown bullets around contract lines, but
  # nothing looser: output with neither token is unusable and the caller
  # records a leaf_error rather than guessing.
